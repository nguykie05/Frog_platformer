# Frog_platformer

Frog platformer is a platformer game where the player control a sprite
and move it side-to-side trying to get past the enemies and traps in 
order to get the end.

Created working animations for different sprites such as the player 
and enemies moving, attacking, and idling; traps activating; and 
ending scenes using Pixel Art.

Created a working ground and working platforms that help the player 
travel through the level and walk over the traps.

Created working special effects for the blood drops as the player died 
and a sword swing as a projectile to represent the swing effects.
